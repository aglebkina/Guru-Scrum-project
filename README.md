#### Daily StandUp meeting:  
* Developer 1 - I worked ont he login module, and faced problem with validations. Today will work on more validations for the login module  
* Developer 2 - I worked on Mini Statement Module, and faced problem fetching existing records for a customer from Database and showing them in dropdown.  
Now this is resolved. Today will work on Balance Enquiry Module  
* Tester - I worked on studying product and sprint backlog and sprint estimates, and I found issue with password modification user story.  
It is not secure. There should be a 2-step verification process for password modification. I will test the current version of the site.  
* Scrum Master - asks tester to help unit test login module for Developer 1, He likes idea of 2-step verification process for password change and informs product owner. The product owner likes it but needs approval of Customer. He puts the user-story in Block List.  

Sprint 1 in progress
